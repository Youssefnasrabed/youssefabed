# Anaconda and Metis Environment Instructions

Anaconda is an open-source distribution of Python and package management platform that makes it easier to install and update the Python packages that are most commonly used in data-driven programming. Metis students taking a course with Python programming are expected to use Anaconda, and it **should be installed before the course begins, including the Metis environment**.  Installing the Metis environment is the easiest way to access all Python packages required in order to run course content code as well as complete project work. This involves two steps:        

1. You will need to install conda/anaconda, which is what we use to install other python packages. 
    - If you are **installing Anaconda for the first time**, see the detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/thisismetis/NBM_Metis_Fundamentals/tree/master/anaconda_and_metis_env/anaconda_installation).
    - If you already have conda working on your computer (meaning you can run `conda -V`) you can skip to the next step.
2. Next you will need to install the Metis environment. See [here](https://github.com/thisismetis/NBM_Metis_Fundamentals/blob/master/anaconda_and_metis_env/metis_env_instructions.md) for instructions on how to install and work within the Metis Anaconda environment
